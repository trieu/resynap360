    * Principle of Least Privilege is applied to all IAM roles and policies.  
    * Network security is configured (VPCs, subnets, security groups, NACLs) to restrict access.  
    * Data is encrypted at rest (S3, DBs, Kafka topics) and in transit (HTTPS, SSL/TLS).  
    * Input validation and output encoding are implemented to prevent common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi).  
    * The Secret management solution is used for API keys, database credentials, etc.  
    * Regular security vulnerability scans are planned and executed.  

* **Test Cases:**  
    * **TC-017-01:** Review IAM roles for overly permissive policies.  
    * **TC-017-02:** Verify encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive data stores and communication channels.  
    * **TC-017-03:** Perform penetration testing (or basic vulnerability scanning) on exposed API endpoints.  
    * **TC-017-04:** Test input validation mechanisms by attempting to inject malicious data.  
    * **TC-017-05:** Verify access controls prevent unauthorized users/services from accessing restricted resources or functionalities.  
    * **TC-017-06:** Audit secrets management practices.

### **TASK-018: End-to-End Customer Journey & System Integration Testing**

* **Story Points:** 13  
* **Priority:** High  
* **Components:** All Platform Components  
* **Description:** Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of complete customer journeys and critical system workflows. This includes testing data flow, integration points, overall system performance, and resilience.  

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * Key customer journeys (e.g., web visit \-\> event capture \-\> profile update \-\> personalized AI interaction) are validated from start to finish.  
    * Data consistency is maintained across all integrated systems and databases throughout the workflows.  
    * System performs within defined SLAs under expected and peak load conditions.  
    * Error handling and recovery mechanisms function correctly across component boundaries.  
    * All critical integration points between services are tested and verified.  

* **Test Cases:**  
    * **TC-018-01:** Test a complete customer journey: new web visitor \-\> event captured by SDK \-\> F1 processing \-\> data in Raw Data Lake \-\> F2 persistence \-\> F3 profile creation \-\> profile in Entity Resolution DB & Cache \-\> F4 notification \-\> AI Agent uses new profile for personalization.  
    * **TC-018-02:** Verify data consistency for a single customer across Raw Data Lake, Entity Resolution DB, Data Cache, and CRM (if synced).  
    * **TC-018-03:** Simulate peak load conditions (e.g., 1000 events/sec) and measure system response times and stability.  
    * **TC-018-04:** Test system behavior during failure of a single component (e.g., F3 processor down) and verify recovery process.  
    * **TC-018-05:** Confirm compliance with data processing SLAs for critical paths (e.g., time from event to profile update).  
    * **TC-018-06:** Test CRM data synchronization end-to-end, including conflict resolution.

## **Summary**

* **Total Tasks:** 18  
* **Total Story Points (Estimated):** 185  
* **High Priority Tasks:** 12  
* **Medium Priority Tasks:** 6

## **Dependencies :**

* Core infrastructure (VPC, IAM basics, Kafka cluster if self-managed) must be set up before application component development.  
* Raw Data Lake (TASK-004) and Entity Resolution DB (TASK-005) setup are prerequisites for F1, F2, F3 development.  
* The F3 Processor (TASK-009) is a central piece; many downstream components depend on its output.  
* Vector Database (TASK-008) needed before full AI agent personalization (TASK-007).  
* Governance System (TASK-011, TASK-012) should be implemented early to guide data handling and schema.
